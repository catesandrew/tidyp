libtidyp is a fork of libtidy on SourceForge.  The library name is
"tidyp", and the command-line tool is also "tidyp" but all internal API
stays the same.

If you're using GCC and GNU make, here's how to build:

    $ cd build/gmake
    $ make

To run the test suite:

    $ cd test
    $ ./testall.sh
