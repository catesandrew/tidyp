Changelog for libtidyp

0.99    Mon Feb 22 00:19:30 CST 2010
====================================
Distributed with a ./configure script.  No need to mess with autoconf.

Removed RPM and MSVC support.  If anyone wants, they can ask for it
and I'll add it back.  For now, I have no reason to think that they
actually work.

Removed the tab2space executable.

Added a version number, and removed the Release Date functionality.
A release date is not a usable version number.

The function tidyVersion() has been added.

The function tidyReleaseDate() has been removed.
